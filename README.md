## Technology/Technical Design
In completing this task, I use the javascript programming language and ReactJs as the library. The reason I use javascript is because javascript is perfect for building interactive websites. I use ReactJS because ReactJS combines the speed of JavaScript and uses a new way of rendering webpages, making them highly dynamic and responsive to user input. I also use CSS for describing the presentation and design of my web pages.
